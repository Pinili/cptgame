IDEAS V2:

Nonviolence is a crucial aspect of the game.
How do we have a dungeon game with nonviolence?
BY PROMOTING CLEANLINESS AND RAT EXTERMINATION.

HP -> Cleanliness/Dirtiness (high levels of dirty -> pass out from the dirt)
Attack -> Clean!

Classes that you can start off as?:
	MAID - Good against dirty things. Starts off with a dust swiffer(?) or vaccum cleaner or broom or windex bottle. Maybe starts off with cleaning items/cleaning skills (heals) (like an AP character in league?)
	EXTERMINATOR - Good against vermin. Starts off with basic extermination gear. Skill points in poison-gas-resistance OR they start with a gas mask. (like a ranged AD carry in league?)
	SLOB - Tank. Can absorb a lot of dirtiness before collapsing. (like a tank in league?)

	 * Important Note: Lets not make too many entities... keep in mind we need to make images for these and animations. ALSO IMPORTANT THING! should we make a package for entityAnimations?

	 SIR NERMAN. That is not what EntityID means. EntityID is like a name you would give a person. There can be two bears, but they have different names because they are different people.
	 EntityID will be the index of the entity
