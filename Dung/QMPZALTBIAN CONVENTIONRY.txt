The Conventions of Qmpzaltb

Variable names begin with their data type.
For example, integers begin with i, resulting in variable names such as iAppleAmount, iAnswerToLife.

Primitive data types typically begin with 1 character prefixing the variable name (with the exception of Byte because its funny)
A LIST OF PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE VARIABLE NAME PREFIXES:
Byte 		- by
Boolean 	- b
Integer 	- i
Double		- d
Short		- s
Long 		- l

Prefixes for object variable names should have three letters. For example (This list is incomplete. I will not list all the objects in Java):
String 		- str
Scanner		- scn
Random		- rng (Random number generator. Sometimes this is more concise. I don't know)
SkeletonLimb- skl
Entity		- ent

Rules for Array Naming Conventions
After the initial prefix, make an "a" denoting that this is an array.
For multidimensional arrays (2D +), add a number after the A to denote it as such.
For example, a 2D array of dungeon tiles could look like this: dtla2DungeonTiles.
(It looks neater when you do it with primitive data types, such as ia2Elevations)

When you do array list, do "al" instead of a.
