ICS4U1 CULMINATING PERFORMANCE TASK -- [A Dungeon Game that is yet to be named].

WHAT IS THIS GAME ALL ABOUT?

  -Your friend has dared you into escaping a dungeon, and you accept his dare.
  
  -Truth is, there is no exit to this dungeon. Every exit in a randomly generated dungeon leads to another randomly generated dungeon.
  
  -Your goal is to survive the longest in this jungle. (The character you play as does not know this, he/she just assumes there will be an exit)


TODO:

  -Get the basic, "low-level" stuff done first. This includes setting up the Entity classes, AI, Keyboard input classes, Threads, etc. (Basic stuff to play the game)
  
  -Design sprite animations, music, GUI, etc (Flavouring the game up)
  
FUTURE GOALS:

  -Network to play with friends (Ring topology?)

OTHER STUFF TO NOTE:

  -This game is a project that will be written in Java only.
