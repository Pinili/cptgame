ICS4U1 CULMINATING PERFORMANCE TASK -- [A Dungeon Game that is yet to be named].

WHAT IS THIS GAME ALL ABOUT?

  - Through some form of circumstance, you, the Player, end up in a pseudo-infinitely long cave/dungeon.
  - Your job is to survive. The main challenge is the inherent toxic "dirtiness" of the cave/dungeon.
  - When your dirtiness reaches a critical level, you become a slave to the forces of dirty. Game over.
  - Finding the exit to the dungeon will require meticulous cleaning and vermin extermination.
  - The exit has a low chance (.1%? .5%? .01%?) of having an exit to the surface, which the player can either choose to take,
  or to continue on with cleaning.
