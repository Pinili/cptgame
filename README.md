This is the Culminating Performance Task -- [A Dungeon Game that is yet to be named].
by three CS highschool students.

What is this game all about?
  -Your friend has dared you into escaping this dungeon, and you accept his dare.
  -Truth is, there is no exit to this dungeon. Every exit in a randomly generated dungeon leads to another randomly generated dungeon.
  -Your goal is to survive the longest in this jungle. (The character you play as does not know this, he/she just assumes there will be an exit)

Todo:
  -Get the basic, "low-level" stuff done first. This includes setting up the Entity classes, AI, Keyboard input classes, Threads, etc. (Basic stuff to play the game)
  -Design sprite animations, music, GUI, etc (Flavouring the game up)
  
Future Goals:
  -Network to play with friends (Ring topology?)

Other Stuff to Note:
  -This game is a project that will be written in Java only.
